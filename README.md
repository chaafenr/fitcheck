## Description
Our app is designed to make fashion fun by gamifying everyday style and inspiring creativity. Here’s how it works: each night, users receive a theme for the next day’s outfit- think “red” or “denim.” The next day, they share photos of their outfits, and friends vote on who nailed the theme best. It’s like “BeReal,” but for outfits, with a competitive twist.
