NOTES FOR PM:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- S3 Bucket Integration?

NOTES TO OURSELVES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Image processing --> when users take a photo, the feed crops it so that it is in a square format
it does not allow for the full image to be seen, so if someone were taking a photo of their outfit
their shoes or hat for example could be cut off based off the centering of our feed format.

Chaafen:
=============
Progress & Issues:
- Worked with Yasmine on the back end
- Modified dependencies and Runner settings in Xcode, managed to rid all iOS errors
  - Now i am facing an AWS error, where it won't let me use objects from AWS without new import statements
    but when i make new import statements it says they are redundant
- Worked on Beta++ sections: known bugs, how to access source code
- Looked through reddit and stack overflow for info on our AWS issue

Goals for the Week:
- Meet with Yasmine and work on re-installing AWS features
- Align my Runner settings with her as well
- Meet in office hours or seek assistance

Goals for Next Week:
- If AWS is not set-up, figure out if Firebase is something we can integrate at this point

Lauren:
=============
Progress & Issues:
- Update project backlogs
- Completed Beta++ sections: How to Run Software, How to Run Tests
- Having issues running app on Android Emulator -- However, app runs fine on Xcode on my side
- Strayed away from CodeMagic, implemented GitHub Actions as our CI for FitCheck
- Added additional test cases for sign up, home page, and "taking a photo"

Goals for the Week:
- Finalize profile page once backend is complete/resolved
- Ensure that profile page has folders - similar to pinterest of user's outfits (also do research on this as well)
- Create a settings portion -- figure out how to have backend and frontend work together if
someone were to for example, want to change their username, bio, or name display!
- Add different categories to cycle through the outfit of the day themes
- Once backend complete, be able to have every team member create a profile --> probably just sample phone numbers inside database!
- Add email authentication in addition to the phone number


Goals for Next Week:
- If not finished with profile page additions, finalize this next week!
- If backend is not finished til late this week, all sections that are waiting will be pushed to next week's goals.
