NOTES FOR PM:

- S3 Bucket Integration?

NOTES TO OURSELVES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Image processing --> when users take a photo, the feed crops it so that it is in a square format
it does not allow for the full image to be seen, so if someone were taking a photo of their outfit
their shoes or hat for example could be cut off based off the centering of our feed format.
