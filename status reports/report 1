- Start making Figma sketches
Goals for Next Week:
- Finish final figma sketches
- Start organizing the app development features and who is going to work on what
- Figure out the framework we are going to have

Chaafen:
=============
Progress & Issues:
- Wrote the product description and dertermined the 8 main features and the priority of them with Yasmine.
