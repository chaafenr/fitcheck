Progress & Issues:

- Having issues with the backend, havent looked into AWS but for phone authentication with firebase 
even though everything felt set up correctly it wasnt correctly sending the code to the phone and not using the test phone

Chaafen:
=============
Progress & Issues:
- Worked with Yasmine on the back end
- Modified dependencies and Runner settings in Xcode, managed to rid all iOS errors
  - Now i am facing an AWS error, where it won't let me use objects from AWS without new import statements
    but when i make new import statements it says they are redundant
- Worked on Beta++ sections: known bugs, how to access source code
- Looked through reddit and stack overflow for info on our AWS issue

Goals for the Week:
- Meet with Yasmine and work on re-installing AWS features
- Align my Runner settings with her as well
- Meet in office hours or seek assistance

Goals for Next Week:
- If AWS is not set-up, figure out if Firebase is something we can integrate at this point

Lauren:
=============
Progress & Issues:
- Update project backlogs
- Completed Beta++ sections: How to Run Software, How to Run Tests
- Having issues running app on Android Emulator -- However, app runs fine on Xcode on my side
- Strayed away from CodeMagic, implemented GitHub Actions as our CI for FitCheck
- Added additional test cases for sign up, home page, and "taking a photo"

Goals for the Week:
- Finalize profile page once backend is complete/resolved
- Ensure that profile page has folders - similar to pinterest of user's outfits (also do research on this as well)
- Create a settings portion -- figure out how to have backend and frontend work together if
someone were to for example, want to change their username, bio, or name display!
- Add different categories to cycle through the outfit of the day themes
- Once backend complete, be able to have every team member create a profile --> probably just sample phone numbers inside database!
- Add email authentication in addition to the phone number


Goals for Next Week:
- If not finished with profile page additions, finalize this next week!
- If backend is not finished til late this week, all sections that are waiting will be pushed to next week's goals.
